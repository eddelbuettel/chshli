Description: R packages can be downloaded from a repository for the 'RStudio Package Manager'
 or 'RSPM' which provides prebuilt binaries for several Linux distributions easing installing
 considerably. However, these packages do not have system level support for their run-time
 dependencies.  This packages aims to address this shortcoming with a first application for
 Ubuntu 18.04 aka 'bionic'.
